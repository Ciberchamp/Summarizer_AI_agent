"Here's a 7-bullet point summary of the key points from the provided text:\n\n* The Universal Credit Act 2025 sets out changes to the standard allowance for universal credit for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, with the amounts increasing by at least the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) percentage and uplift percentage for each tax year.\n* The standard allowance will be increased by the following percentages for each tax year: 4.6% (2026-27), 6.2% (2027-28), 8.0% (2028-29), and 9.6% (2029-30).\n* The Limited Capability for Work and Work-Related Activity (LCWRA) element of universal credit will be amended to include a new rate of \u00a3217.26 for claimants with limited capability for work and work-related activity, other than pre-2026 claimants, severe conditions criteria claimants, or claimants who are terminally ill.\n* For tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, the annual up-rating of benefits for the LCWRA element and the LCW element will be frozen, meaning these benefits will not increase in line with inflation.\n* The Universal Credit Act 2025 introduces new definitions and provisions related to the LCWRA element, including the concept of a \"pre-2026 claimant\" and a \"severe conditions criteria claimant\".\n* A claimant is considered to have a severe condition if they have a specific mental illness or disablement that has been diagnosed by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional in the course of NHS services.\n* The changes to the standard allowance and LCWRA element will come into force on 6 April 2026 and will apply to assessment periods commencing on or after that date."
